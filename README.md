### Design documentation:


* Design process

    The inspiration of this webpage is from a game called persona 5 and social application called line. And the conceptual design is like the moodboard displayed below. As the core color for the design is red which is a strong color. I picked white, grey and black to combine with. 

    During the design stage, I also used adbobe xd to design the layout so that I have a better understanding about I want to achieve. The design of this project started from a mobile friendly layout, and then moved to tablet layout and pc layout. By doing such, it effectively reduced the amount of work of resizing blocks and images.

    And as a part of requirement for this assignment, table, flex and grid is another big focus of the design. By applying table, flex and grid gave a clean layout about the content.

* Usability considerations

    The deisgn concept of this project is to keep things simple while providing the necessary infomation. As a result,the websites provides more pictures and gif files instead of lined of texts.
    
    And as it is more common for users to have multiple devices nowadays, resposive design is also one of focuses when developing the website. Therefore, each devices has a different layout that best suits the device. At the moment, it supoorts mobile, tablet and pc (currently not supporting 4k screen).
    
    A good example is the navigation bar. When user uses mobile for the website, the navigation bar will be a drop-down menu. But for tablet and pc, it will be a bar sticks on top of the screen. 
    
    For user reading experience, texts and images will be adjusted accordingly. The text color and font are remained consistant for the whole page. And the selection of the font color has a strong contrast with the background color so that it is more obvious to users.

    For the functionality part, the navigation bar and all links are succeffsully functioning where will direct the user to related section or external websites. The only exception for now is the form submiting function. As there is no related database, the website will reposrt errors when users try to submit a contact form. 

    Another concern for this portfolio is the capability for different browsers. The website is functioning as expected on latest version of chrome, firefox and safari. There are some issues with IE browser as IE doesn't support some codes like sticky which is a future feature in plan.
